                	<p>I've always wanted to get a formal education about Makeup Artistry.
                	But it's been foregone due to either I don't have the funds or I just 
                	couldn't skip work. <i>I have to work, you know. I need to fund my makeup addiction.</i></p>
                	    
                	   	<h2 class="section-heading">Jasmine Brock</h2>
                	    <p>I was introduced to Jasmine Brock,
                	    owner of Pure Glam Makeup Academy and my very first Makeup Mentor.
                	    Jasmine's expertise is unquestionable. As always, I was amazed 
                	    whenever she does her demo'es (and I always wished I'd reach that level).
                	    She is passionate about teaching and I 
                	    could see that on how she passes on her knowledge to us her students.
                	    Aside from that, she is so fun to work with! I was always looking 
                	    forward for the next day. </p>

                	    <p>Pure Glam Makeup Academy is the only school I know in San Antonio that
                	    provides Night classes for professionals like me.                	    
                	    <p>This workshop has jumpstarted my "career" as a Makeup Artist. The course outline
                	    is intensive, covers all the basics and advanced techniques of Makeup Artistry
                	    that you'll use for your potential clients. I love that the first thing we learned is
                	    about cleanliness and how to keep your tools hygienic for your clients. 
                	    I'm a neat freak and it's very important to me.</p>

                	    <p>When you enroll to the workshop it's an all-in deal. Forgive me for sounding like 
                	    a beginner here but I love that it comes with all the tools that you need to start your career:
                	    Your Makeup Case, Foundation Palette, Eyeshadow Palettes, Lip Palettes, Blush and Contour Palette,
                	    your first set of Brushes, and a whole lot more.</p>
                	    
                	    <p>To be honest I didn't know any other brands aside from the brands that are on the shelves of 
                	    Sephora and Ulta (and MAC of course). I never got out of that bounds. This workshop introduced me
                	    to BH Cosmetics, the sponsor for the course. Up to this day I am still using it, I ran out of
                	    some though, but the brushes are still intact.</p>

                	    <p>During Special Effects Course, I learned about Mehron and Ben Nye, which turned out to be
                	    big suppliers for Special Effects makeup kits.</p>

                	    <p>I wasn't as picture-conscious during the class nights so I wasn't able to get a lot of shots,
                	    except for the last sessions. Some of the work I missed shooting are my No-Makeup Look, 
                	    Light-Natural Look (kind-of a favorite), Pin-Up, Cat-Eye (that was a hard one for me, takes practice).
                	    Here are some of the stuff I got to capture.
                	    </p>

                    	<p>I know I could have done a little better on the Colored-Smokey department but 
                    	I think I'm quite proud of the brows I did here. This workshop (not the internet) 
                    	taught me first that the brows shouldn't be ignored when doing makeup. I had been taking my time on brows
                    	since then. Sometimes it slowed me down, but again, takes a lot of practice to master it.</p>
                    	
                	    <p>It's so nice that there are models whom we could apply our learnings on all the time!
                	    The models are diverse as well, we are trained on applying the correct 
                	    foundation or colors on different skin tones.</p>

                	    <p>There are times when Jasmine has to take over on the modeling department when 
                	    the models couldn't make it. Here is my final Avante Garde look.</p>

                    	<p>Here's the other side. I thought that you could go crazy with Avante Garde but not literally.
                    	You could go crazy as long as you are following a sort-of process. You can't just put paint
                    	on the model and hope that it would come out as some sort of an abstract art. Well, at least
                    	for me - I have to slow down on the color application and just build up.</p>

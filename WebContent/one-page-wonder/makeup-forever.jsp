                    <p>I stood in front of the Makeup Forever Academy Building door, a little unfamiliar but giddy. 
                    It's really not that hard to find, it's just by Broadway and there's a Banana Republic Store beside its door.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Roque Cozzette</h2>
                    <p>On our first day we were introduced to Roque Cozzette, 
                    world-renowned Makeup Artist, and owner of Cozzette Beauty. 
                    I never imagined that I'd be this close to a Celebrity Makeup Artist and/or a Celebrity. 
                    Roque (pronounced as "Rowkey") is not just a Makeup Artist, he is everything else!
                    He's a photographer, painter, web designer, etc. The most surprising thing I experienced in his class 
                    is his motivational and inspirational messages. What I learned from this class is more than just
                    Airbrush Makeup. To top it all, he's also funny and so light-hearted.
                    Some things that sticked.</p>
                    <blockquote>Surround yourself with "good vibes". Just block negativity out of your way. 
                    Believe in yourself, learn from your mistakes and move on. (on haters and unsatisfied clients)</blockquote>
                    <blockquote>Find your purpose as a Makeup Artist. And the purpose I suggest for you is to 
                    just get paid. There is value in what you do.</blockquote>
                    <p>Since this is not really the main industry I am in and that this is just a 
                    hobby, I often de-value what I do and offer free makeup services a lot. Roque asked me to stop. </p>
                    <img class="img-responsive" 
                   		src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/content/img/one-page-wonder/makeup-forever/roque-day1-demo.jpg" 
                    		alt="Joane Denise's Makeup Forever Academy Adventures">
                    <p>Every day is demo day. Here, he demo'ed the basics of airbrush. 
                    It was my first time to see an actual air-brush, can you imagine how I felt to see it in action.</p>
                    <img class="img-responsive" 
                   		src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/content/img/one-page-wonder/makeup-forever/day1-beauty.jpg" 
                    		alt="Joane Denise's Makeup Forever Academy Adventures">
                    <p>I was so curious how it would look like up-close. My main questions were - will it look cakey? Does it feel heavy? 
                    Apparently it isn't.</p>
                    <img class="img-responsive" 
                   		src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/content/img/one-page-wonder/makeup-forever/day1-beauty-closeup.jpg" 
                    		alt="Joane Denise's Makeup Forever Academy Adventures">
                    <p>Something that blew my mind a bit is about "minimalism". You don't have to airbrush everything 
                    because "that's just the way it should be". Make it as natural as possible by 
                    going through the process of "Neutralize and Even out".</p>
                    <p>Neutralization is very related to Color Theory. You have to target the spots first that 
                    require color correction. The same concept that we use for the traditional makeup totally applies to 
                    Airbrush as well. </p>
                    
                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Tools</h2>
                    <img class="img-responsive" 
                   		src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/content/img/one-page-wonder/makeup-forever/kett-jett.jpg" 
                    		alt="Joane Denise's Makeup Forever Academy Adventures">
                    <p>I was introduced to Kett Cosmetics, Cozzette Brushes and the Kett Jett.
                    I was under the impression that airbrush compressors are big and all. 
                    The Ket Jett is small and decent size. It's something I could carry on-the-go.</p>
                    <img class="img-responsive"

                    		alt="Joane Denise's Makeup Forever Academy Adventures">
                    <p>Oh my those Cozzette Brushes, I am in-love with them! There are plenty of things I realized in this workshop.
                    And one of them is about the tools I use and how I fall right away for those commercial ones.
                    For example, I bought some MAC brushes because I heard good reviews, but when I got mine,
                    it's not as brilliant as what I was expecting. I should be better at not falling prey to 
                    Sephora / MAC sales tactics. I should probably lean on those tools that are made by artists, not those tools
                    that are endorsed by celebrities or something. The Cozzette brushes are like babies to Roque. 
                    I love how they're made, and the bristles are not a disappointment. And I won't forget about the 
                    cute "Brush Vessels" that you see here, don't you want to sort out your brushes into different containers and
                    color-code them? I would!</p>
                    <img class="img-responsive" 
                   		src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/content/img/one-page-wonder/makeup-forever/the-brush-cleaner.jpg" 
                    		alt="Joane Denise's Makeup Forever Academy Adventures">
                    <p>Finally Roque introduced to us a new way of cleaning the makeup brushes and making them ready for
                    use immediately. It's the next to automation that I can imagine for cleaning brushes. I think I spent 
                    more time cleaning brushes than performing makeup on clients haha! Brush cleaning is already 
                    part of our lives as a Makeup Artist. And this StylPro gadget is something that could help us out.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Face Chart</h2>
                    <p>Something I learned from my Pure Glam training is about utilizing a Face Chart for "planning purposes" 
                    or plainly to plan your looks (for example, for a photo shoot or a fashion show).
                    I had fun actually on those exercises, you remember those times when the coloring book became a hit for adults?
                    Face Charts became my coloring book and the makeup kits became my crayolas.</p>

                    	<p>I know it is hard, because just those "dot and dash" exercises we had were a challenge for first-timers

                    <p>I am completely aware that attending a Workshop or Training won't make me the best out there. 
					Apart from Talent - Practice, Persistence and Experience are really what makes Makeup Artists better, I think. 
					And I know I'm not there yet. On the first day of the workshop after introducing myself to the class, 
					feeling a little out of place with questions of what is this IT person doing here,
					Roque told me - "Don't you call yourself a Beginner nor second-doubt yourself anymore. 
					From now on, you are a Makeup Artist, you should own it." Yessir! </p>

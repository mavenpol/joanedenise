                	    pouring out wild emotional content and all. Makeup Forever Academy was part of my Makeup Artist "bucket-list",
                	    so it's gonna be a bit hard to recall all these events but not feeling so excited at the same time.

                    <p>I stood in front of the Makeup Forever Academy Building door, a little unfamiliar but giddy. 
                    It's really not that hard to find, it's just by Broadway and there's a Banana Republic Store beside its door.

                    unicorns and stars and sunshine came in alive. Okey I know I know, I will stop the emotions.
                    Makeup Forever Academy is at the 3rd Floor of the Building.</p>

                    <p>There are I think 4 workshop rooms in there. I haven't been to the other areas, but 
                    the one where we are in are very conducive for makeup learning. The lights are awesome, 
                    the workstations are very well separated. There are Makeup Forever products everywhere! 
                    And they are free to use (for learning of course :D).</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Roque Cozzette</h2>
                    <p>On our first day we were introduced to Roque Cozzette, 
                    world-renowned Makeup Artist, and owner of Cozzette Beauty. 
                    I never imagined that I'd be this close to a Celebrity Makeup Artist and/or a Celebrity. 
                    Roque (pronounced as "Rowkey") is not just a Makeup Artist, he is everything else!
                    He's a photographer, painter, web designer, etc. The most surprising thing I experienced in his class 
                    is his motivational and inspirational messages. What I learned from this class is more than just
                    Airbrush Makeup. For example, a few things that sticked.</p>
                    <blockquote>Surround yourself with "good vibes". Just block negativity out of your way. 
                    Believe in yourself, learn from your mistakes and move on. (on haters and unsatisfied clients)</blockquote>
                    <blockquote>Find your purpose as a Makeup Artist. And the purpose I suggest for you is to 
                    just get paid. There is value in what you do.</blockquote>
                    <p>Since this is not really the main industry I am in and that this is just a 
                    hobby, I often de-value what I do and offer free makeup services a lot. Roque asked me to stop.
                    I know that it's just </p>

                   		src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/content/img/one-page-wonder/makeup-forever/roque-day1-demo.jpg" 
                    		alt="Joane Denise's Makeup Forever Academy Adventures">
                    <p>Every day is demo day. Here, he demo'ed the basics of airbrush. 
                    It's my first time to see an actual air-brush.</p>
                    <img class="img-responsive" 
                   		src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/content/img/one-page-wonder/makeup-forever/day1-beauty.jpg" 
                    		alt="Joane Denise's Makeup Forever Academy Adventures">
                    I was so curious how it would look like up-close. My main questions were - will it look cakey? Does it feel heavy? 
                    Apparently it isn't.
                    <img class="img-responsive" 
                   		src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/content/img/one-page-wonder/makeup-forever/day1-beauty-closeup.jpg" 
                    		alt="Joane Denise's Makeup Forever Academy Adventures">
                    <p>Something that blew my mind a bit is about "minimalism". You don't have to airbrush everything 
                    because "that's just the way it should be". Make it as natural as possible by 
                    going through the process of "Neutralize and Even out".</p>
                    <p>Neutralization is very related to Color Theory. You have to target the spots first that 
                    require color correction. The same concept that we use for the traditional makeup totally applies to 
                    Airbrush as well. 
                    
                    
                    <p>So here are what we talked about on our first day.</p>
                    <ul>
                    		<li>Why Airbrush?</li>
                    		<li>Color Theory</li>
                    		<li>Applying: Dot & Dash</li>
                    		<li>Cleaning</li>
                    		<li>Airbrushing the Face Chart</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    The whole time Roque is demo-ing and instructing, I am not sure if I am 
                    really absorbing everything. I was sitting there watching him work and just in awe-ing in amazement.
                    <p>There are very good learning materials that came in with the Workshop. I'm sure it's all on
                    the internet. However, hearing it from the master and seeing him in action really makes a 
                    lot of difference in the learning process.</p>

                    <blockquote>The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

                    <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

					<h2 class="section-heading">Next Steps</h2>
					<p>I am completely aware that attending a Workshop or Training won't make me the best out there. 
					Apart from Talent - Practice, Persistence and Experience are really what makes Makeup Artists better, I think. 
					And I know I'm not there yet. On the first day of the workshop after introducing myself to the class, 
					feeling a little out of place with questions of what is this IT consultant doing here,
					Roque told me - "Don't you call yourself a Beginner nor second-doubt yourself anymore. 
					From now on, you are a Makeup Artist, you should own it." Sure I will! </p>

					<h2 class="section-heading">Makeup Forever Academy</h2>
					<p>So there I was, standing in front of the Makeup Forever
						Academy Building door, a little unfamiliar but giddy. I will try
						my best to avoid pouring out wild emotional feelings and all on
						this post. Makeup Forever Academy was part of my Makeup Artist
						"bucket-list", so it's going to be a bit hard to recall all these
						events but not feel so excited at the same time.</p>

						alt="Joane Denise's Makeup Forever Academy Adventures">
					<p>The pieces of artwork and photographs laid across the
						hallway made the short walk to the Elevator a little enchanting.</p>

						alt="Joane Denise's Makeup Forever Academy Adventures">
					<p>Here I am! Right in front of that Lovely Logo.</p>

						alt="Joane Denise's Makeup Forever Academy Adventures">
					<p>I'm feeling the New York here. It's industrial but elegant.</p>
					<img class="img-responsive"
						src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/assets-page/img/makeup-forever/classroom.jpg"
						alt="Joane Denise's Makeup Forever Academy Adventures">
					<p>There are I think 4 workshop rooms in there. I haven't been
						to the other areas, but the one where we are in are very conducive
						for makeup learning. The lights are awesome, the workstations are
						very well separated.</p>
					<img class="img-responsive"
						src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/assets-page/img/makeup-forever/makeup-chairs.jpg"
						alt="Joane Denise's Makeup Forever Academy Adventures">
					<p>And I long to have those Makeup Chairs! We use the same
						chairs for class and for the hands-on. There are plenty.</p>
					<img class="img-responsive"
						src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/assets-page/img/makeup-forever/mufe-all-over.jpg"
						alt="Joane Denise's Makeup Forever Academy Adventures">
					<p>There are Makeup Forever products everywhere! And they are
						free to use (for learning of course :D).</p>

					<h2 class="section-heading">Roque Cozzette</h2>
					<p>We were introduced to Roque Cozzette, world-renowned Makeup
						Artist, and owner of Cozzette Beauty. I never imagined that I'd be
						this close to a Celebrity Makeup Artist and/or a Celebrity. Roque
						(pronounced as "Rowkey") is not just a Makeup Artist, he is
						everything else! He's a photographer, painter, web designer, etc.
						The most surprising thing I experienced in his class were his
						motivational and inspirational messages. What I learned from this
						class are more than just Airbrush Makeup. To top it all, he's also
						funny and so light-hearted. And here are some motivational things
						that sticked.</p>
					<blockquote>Surround yourself with "good vibes". Just
						block negativity out of your way. Believe in yourself, learn from
						your mistakes and move on. (on haters and unsatisfied clients)</blockquote>
					<blockquote>Find your purpose as a Makeup Artist. And
						the purpose I suggest for you is to just get paid. There is value
						in what you do.</blockquote>
					<img class="img-responsive"
						src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/assets-page/img/makeup-forever/roque-day1-demo.jpg"
						alt="Joane Denise's Makeup Forever Academy Adventures">
					<p>Every day is demo day. Here, he demo'ed the basics of
						airbrush.</p>
					<img class="img-responsive"
						src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/assets-page/img/makeup-forever/day1-beauty.jpg"
						alt="Joane Denise's Makeup Forever Academy Adventures">
					<p>I was so curious how it would look like up-close. My main
						questions were - will it look cakey? Does it feel heavy?
						Apparently it isn't.</p>
					<img class="img-responsive"
						src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/assets-page/img/makeup-forever/day1-beauty-closeup.jpg"
						alt="Joane Denise's Makeup Forever Academy Adventures">
					<p>Something that blew my mind a bit is about "minimalism". You
						don't have to airbrush everything because "that's just the way it
						should be". Make it as natural as possible by going through the
						process of "Neutralize and Even out".</p>
					<p>Neutralization is very related to Color Theory. You have to
						target the spots first that require color correction. The same
						concept that we use for the traditional makeup totally applies to
						Airbrush as well.</p>

					<h2 class="section-heading">The Tools</h2>
					<p>I was under the impression that airbrush compressors are big
						and all.</p>
					<img class="img-responsive"
						src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/assets-page/img/makeup-forever/kett-jett.jpg"
						alt="Joane Denise's Makeup Forever Academy Adventures">
					<p>I was introduced to Kett Cosmetics, Cozzette Brushes and the
						Kett Jett. The Ket Jett is small and decent size. It's something I
						could carry on-the-go.</p>
					<img class="img-responsive"
						src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/assets-page/img/makeup-forever/cozzette-and-kett.jpg"
						alt="Joane Denise's Makeup Forever Academy Adventures">
					<p>I am in-love with those Cozzette Brushes!</p>
					<p>There are plenty of things I realized in this workshop. And
						one of them is about the tools I use and how I fall right away for
						those commercial ones. For example, I bought some MAC brushes
						because they are popular. But when I got mine, some are not as
						brilliant as what I was expecting. I should be better at not
						falling prey to Sephora / MAC sales tactics. I should probably
						lean on those tools that are made by artists, not those tools that
						are endorsed by celebrities or something. The Cozzette brushes are
						like babies to Roque. I love how they're made, and the bristles
						are not a disappointment. And I won't forget about the cute "Brush
						Vessels" that you see here, don't you want to sort out your
						brushes into different containers and color-code them? I would!</p>
					<img class="img-responsive"
						src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/assets-page/img/makeup-forever/the-brush-cleaner.jpg"
						alt="Joane Denise's Makeup Forever Academy Adventures">
					<p>Finally Roque introduced to us a new way of cleaning the
						makeup brushes and making them ready for use immediately. It's the
						next to automation that I can imagine for cleaning brushes. I
						think I spent more time cleaning brushes than performing makeup on
						clients haha! Brush cleaning is already part of our lives as a
						Makeup Artist. And this StylPro gadget is something that could
						help us out.</p>

					<h2 class="section-heading">Face Chart</h2>
					<p>Something I learned from my Pure Glam training is about
						utilizing a Face Chart for "planning purposes" or plainly to plan
						your looks (for example, for a photo shoot or a fashion show).
						During the Airbrush Workshop, I saw how Face Charting was taken to
						the next level.</p>
					<img class="img-responsive"
						src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/assets-page/img/makeup-forever/face-chart-wip.jpg"
						alt="Joane Denise's Makeup Forever Academy Adventures">
					<p>Airbrushing a Face Chart is definitely #goals!</p>
					<img class="img-responsive"
						src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/assets-page/img/makeup-forever/face-chart-more-wip.jpg"
						alt="Joane Denise's Makeup Forever Academy Adventures">
					<p>I know it is hard, because just those "dot and dash"
						exercises we had were a challenge for first-timers like me. But
						Roque here just made it look so easy.</p>
					<img class="img-responsive"
						src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/assets-page/img/makeup-forever/face-chart-details.jpg"
						alt="Joane Denise's Makeup Forever Academy Adventures">
					<p>You can always go back to the brush for those details.</p>
					<img class="img-responsive"
						src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/assets-page/img/makeup-forever/face-chart-final.jpg"
						alt="Joane Denise's Makeup Forever Academy Adventures"> <span
						class="caption text-muted">Final Product</span> <img

						alt="Joane Denise's Makeup Forever Academy Adventures"> <span
						class="caption text-muted">And here is the best way I could
						possibly express my appreciation for Art.</span>

					<h2 class="section-heading">Beauty Makeup</h2>
					<p>After this course I realized that I wanted to concentrate on
						Beauty Makeup.</p>
					<img class="img-responsive"
						src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/assets-page/img/makeup-forever/roque-day2-closer.jpg"
						alt="Joane Denise's Makeup Forever Academy Adventures">
					<p>The whole time Roque is demo-ing and instructing, I am not
						sure if I am really absorbing everything.</p>
					<img class="img-responsive"
						src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/assets-page/img/makeup-forever/roque-on-eye.jpg"
						alt="Joane Denise's Makeup Forever Academy Adventures">
					<p>I was sitting there watching him work and just awe-ing in
						amazement, especially that time when he applied eye shadow via
						Airbrush!</p>
					<p>The final product is obviously a perfection.</p>

					<h2 class="section-heading">Tattoo Coverage</h2>
					<p>The last day, we were taught how to cover a tattoo or some
						body art that for example, a Fashion show don't want to show.</p>

						src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/assets-page/img/makeup-forever/me-and-roque.jpg"
						alt="Joane Denise's Makeup Forever Academy Adventures">
					<p>I am completely aware that attending a Workshop or Training
						won't make me the best out there. Apart from Talent - Practice,
						Persistence and Experience are really what makes Makeup Artists
						better, I think. And I know I'm not there yet. On the first day of
						the workshop after introducing myself to the class, feeling a
						little out of place with questions of what is this software
						developer doing here, Roque told me -</p>
					<blockquote>Don't you call yourself a Beginner nor
						second-doubt yourself anymore. From now on, you are a Makeup
						Artist. You should own it!</blockquote>

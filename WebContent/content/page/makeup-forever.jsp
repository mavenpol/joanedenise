                    <p>So there I was, standing in front of the Makeup Forever Academy Building door, 
                    a little unfamiliar but giddy. I will try my best to avoid pouring out wild emotional feelings and all
                     on this post. 
                    Makeup Forever Academy was part of my Makeup Artist "bucket-list",
                	    so it's going to be a bit hard to recall all these events but not feel so excited at the same time.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Roque Cozzette</h2>
                    <p>We were introduced to Roque Cozzette, 
                    world-renowned Makeup Artist, and owner of Cozzette Beauty. 
                    I never imagined that I'd be this close to a Celebrity Makeup Artist and/or a Celebrity. 
                    Roque (pronounced as "Rowkey") is not just a Makeup Artist, he is everything else!
                    He's a photographer, painter, web designer, etc. The most surprising thing I experienced in his class 
                    were his motivational and inspirational messages. What I learned from this class are more than just
                    Airbrush Makeup. To top it all, he's also funny and so light-hearted.
                    And here are some motivational things that sticked.</p>
                    <blockquote>Surround yourself with "good vibes". Just block negativity out of your way. 
                    Believe in yourself, learn from your mistakes and move on. (on haters and unsatisfied clients)</blockquote>
                    <blockquote>Find your purpose as a Makeup Artist. And the purpose I suggest for you is to 
                    just get paid. There is value in what you do.</blockquote>
                    	<img class="img-responsive" 
                   		src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/assets-page/img/makeup-forever/roque-day1-demo.jpg" 
                    		alt="Joane Denise's Makeup Forever Academy Adventures">
                    	<p>Every day is demo day. Here, he demo'ed the basics of airbrush.</p>
                    <img class="img-responsive" 
                   		src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/assets-page/img/makeup-forever/day1-beauty.jpg" 
                    		alt="Joane Denise's Makeup Forever Academy Adventures">
                    <p>I was so curious how it would look like up-close. My main questions were - will it look cakey? Does it feel heavy? 
                    Apparently it isn't.</p>
                    <img class="img-responsive" 
                   		src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/assets-page/img/makeup-forever/day1-beauty-closeup.jpg" 
                    		alt="Joane Denise's Makeup Forever Academy Adventures">
                    <p>Something that blew my mind a bit is about "minimalism". You don't have to airbrush everything 
                    because "that's just the way it should be". Make it as natural as possible by 
                    going through the process of "Neutralize and Even out".</p>
                    <p>Neutralization is very related to Color Theory. You have to target the spots first that 
                    require color correction. The same concept that we use for the traditional makeup totally applies to 
                    Airbrush as well. </p>
                    
                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Tools</h2>
                    <p>I was under the impression that airbrush compressors are big and all. </p>
                    <img class="img-responsive" 
                   		src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/assets-page/img/makeup-forever/kett-jett.jpg" 
                    		alt="Joane Denise's Makeup Forever Academy Adventures">
                    <p>I was introduced to Kett Cosmetics, Cozzette Brushes and the Kett Jett.
                    The Ket Jett is small and decent size. It's something I could carry on-the-go.</p>
                    <img class="img-responsive" 
                   		src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/assets-page/img/makeup-forever/cozzette-and-kett.jpg" 
                    		alt="Joane Denise's Makeup Forever Academy Adventures">
                    <p>I am in-love with those Cozzette Brushes!</p> 
                    <p>There are plenty of things I realized in this workshop.
                    And one of them is about the tools I use and how I fall right away for those commercial ones.
                    For example, I bought some MAC brushes because they are popular. But when I got mine,
                    some are not as brilliant as what I was expecting. I should be better at not falling prey to 
                    Sephora / MAC sales tactics. I should probably lean on those tools that are made by artists, not those tools
                    that are endorsed by celebrities or something. The Cozzette brushes are like babies to Roque. 
                    I love how they're made, and the bristles are not a disappointment. And I won't forget about the 
                    cute "Brush Vessels" that you see here, don't you want to sort out your brushes into different containers and
                    color-code them? I would!</p>

                    		alt="Joane Denise's Makeup Forever Academy Adventures">
                    <p>Finally Roque introduced to us a new way of cleaning the makeup brushes and making them ready for
                    use immediately. It's the next to automation that I can imagine for cleaning brushes. I think I spent 
                    more time cleaning brushes than performing makeup on clients haha! Brush cleaning is already 
                    part of our lives as a Makeup Artist. And this StylPro gadget is something that could help us out.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Face Chart</h2>
                    <p>Something I learned from my Pure Glam training is about utilizing a Face Chart for "planning purposes" 
                    or plainly to plan your looks (for example, for a photo shoot or a fashion show). During the Airbrush Workshop, 
                    I saw how Face Charting was taken to the next level.</p>

                    	<p>I know it is hard, because just those "dot and dash" exercises we had were a challenge for first-timers 
                    	like me. But Roque here just made it look so easy.</p>

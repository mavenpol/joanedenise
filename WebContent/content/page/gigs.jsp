                    	So, I wanted to share the first gigs I've done in the Makeup Artistry World. 
                    	Slowly, though they're a few, these gigs kind of helped me build the basics 
                    	that a Makeup Artist should have.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Queen of Soul Pageant</h2>
                    <p>Queen of Soul is a yearly Beauty Pageant held during the San Antonio Fiesta Season.
                    From their Facebook page: <i>The purpose of San Antonio Queen of Soul, Incorporated is to develop 
                    and promote female representation of African-American descent in 
                    the City of San Antonio and surrounding areas</i></p>

                    	<span class="caption text-muted">My humble setup</span>
                    <p>This is officially my first gig as a Makeup Artist. Jasmine of Pure Glam Academy asked me to assist 
                    on doing makeup for the girls. I was surprised how it all works. You setup and then 
                    the girls will just sit there with their ready-for-makeup game face on. It's like, boom boom boom!</p>
                    <p>After the hair and makeup, we all went to the backstage, and just waited there 
                    for powder or retouch for the next segment/s (e.g. Talent, Sportswear, Evening Wear, etc...). 
                    <p>I had no idea what we really are supposed to do so I just imitated whatever 
                    Jasmine is doing. I actually realized by just seeing how Jasmine does stuff is that 
                    I need a "Makeup Belt Bag". It's so convenient to have one when you're chasing the girls and all 
                    before they go out of the backstage. I enjoyed every bit of the process here.</p>
                    <p>Finally after Q&A we got to rest and enjoy the show a bit.</p>

                    <p>The sweetest thing that could ever happen to me during that moment is that one of my girls,

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Dora Vera</h2>
                    <p>I want to recognize the Makeup Artists who mentored and helped me start my 
                    career as a Makeup Artist. I am very grateful for meeting Dora Vera, 
                    San Antonio Makeup Artist and owner of The Look Hair and Makeup Studio. 
                    Dora dragged me along to her gigs 
                    and taught me the basics of running (or being in) an assembly line. I see a lot 
                    of experience running through her veins and I am very glad to learn 
                    some from her.
                    </p>
                    	<img class="img-responsive"

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Bevello Fashion Show</h2>
                    <p>I am very nervous going into this Fashion Show because it is
                    another first-time to work behind the runway. I am clueless whether to show 
                    that "hey I'm here and I know what I'm doing" or just chill and go on with it or just plainly faint in there. 
                    The support I got from Dora and the models were phenomenal, those times. 
                    One of the models reminded me nicely to add mascara. Another one helped me 
                    	to contour her face better.</p>

                    	<p>I learned something crucial here - First Impressions Matter. 
                    	This industry is a little judgy (for lack of a better term).
                    	Which makes sense, because for example would you allow a "Threader" to thread your brows when he/she 
                    	has very un-groomed or decently shaped brows? 
                    	It's not enough that you show your clients that you clean your makeup tools every time. Before you even go 
                    	there, be sure that you are clean-looking and presentable.</p>

                    the final photos.</p>

                    <p>I thought 5 girls is manageable in 2 hours. But I was wrong. 
                    I think I spent 70% of my makeup time on the first girl and the rest are just a breeze.</p>

                    <span class="caption text-muted">I managed to survive and complete them all.</span>
                    <p>Another lesson learned here: Time Management.
                    	From the makeup workshops I noted down the steps on getting a whole face makeup done.
                    	During fashion shows or maybe during events with assembly lines of sorts,
                    	those steps need not to be followed procedurally. There really aren't any cookie cutter steps. 
                   	The important thing is that the models get out w/ glowing skin so they won't look pale when the 
                   	lights are on (unless of course if pale is the theme of the show). If you need to skip something, 
                    	surprisingly, those lovely eyeshadows can be skipped. Skin has to go first. To translate - 
                    	Foundation, Brows, Cheeks and Lip Color.</p>

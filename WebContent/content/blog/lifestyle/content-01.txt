My Purseblog

Apart from all the things that I'm doing, I began an addiction around years ago. 

Let me start with my Prada.

I know louis vuitton in my culture is the national bag of OFWs. And mind you it's negative.

However I wanted to ... how louis vuitton is more.

it never goes on sale.

it's damn durable, it can take up to 200 lbs of weight but the straps will never break. 
if it did break anyway, i can take it to the store to have them fixed. 

One night when I was having some sh** going on, I figured I could gain some money by 
selling some of my designer bags.

So I began setting up a mini-studio.<pic>

and started it with Miu Miu. As I snap away the little details, I felt a sudden
hurt. and some emotional what-nots. aside from making me realize how beautiful the bag indeed is that
memories came flowing. it's not just the value of the bag but the memories linked to them

To me, they're not just designer bags. I know it sounded very materialistic for me.
They represent some kind of fulfillment, a lifestyle that I longed to have way way before when I was "poor".

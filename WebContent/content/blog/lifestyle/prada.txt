This is the first Designer Bag that I have ever purchased in my life. And I have to be honest.

I don't know anything about Designer Bags during that time when I bought it except that
it is a status symbol among others. The girls in my office are rocking Designer purses (without worry of theft or
slashers or snatchers along the way)... and I want to be like them. Obviously, I was not that 
confident before. You know for whatever reason I had to long for owning a Designer bag, I was very determined to own 
at least one.

And I was wrong for the "at least one".

And this bag found me. The experience...

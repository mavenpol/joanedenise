I have a full-list of topics (actually, they're my future enhancements that I want to explore to implement and talk about).

1. Converting the Dynamic Web Project into a Maven Project.
2. Gradle or Maven?
3. Will Spring MVC really help me with my vision?
4. Using a CDN. What it is and why is it cool.
5.

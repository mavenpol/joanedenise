Everything that I am doing here won't be possible without the help of my boyfriend. I know I said before that everything you need help 
on can just be extracted from the internet.

However sometimes I feel that it's easier to ask Chee than sift through the search results.

And it's not even just technical, I have zero talent in Photoshop but I am surviving!
